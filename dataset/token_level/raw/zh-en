According to Li Guangjie, the scenic highway is not just a road; rather it needs to integrate transportation and tourism elements. However, the construction of roads and the tourism industry itself are managed by two different departments; the integration of tourism elements into the construction of roads is still limited to building toilets, consultation centers, and advertising boards, and the integration with tourism is not high.	0.7886284589767456

通过从曼宁的 DNA 进行算法分析，并且以此创建了“很可能出现的外表”的 30 幅肖像。希瑟杜威·哈博格以此做出了一个尖刻又略有点无情的评论。他的评论既是对于 DNA 的多意性的，也是对于身份这一概念本身的。
