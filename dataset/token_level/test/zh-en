上一个死去的是他们的编辑和灵感来源，同时也是《Riodoce》的联合创始人哈维尔·瓦尔迪兹·卡德纳斯。
Last to die was their editor and muse, Javier Valdés Cadenas, who co-founded Riodoce.
Last year it was their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdés Cadenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
瓦尔迪兹写过很多关于毒品暴力的书籍，他在其中一本中这样写道：“最大的错误就是住在墨西哥并成为一个记者。”
Valdez, who has written extensively on drug violence, said in one of his books: "The biggest mistake you can make is to live in Mexico and be a journalist."
Warrantz has written extensively on drug violence, telling a colleague in one of his books: "The biggest mistake you can make is to live in Mexico and be a journalist."
大家能够深切感觉到他已经离开，虽然他无处不在——一张巨大的照片挂在《Riodoce》办公楼的正面，瓦尔迪兹竖着中指，配词“正义”；亚伦·伊瓦拉和米里亚姆·拉米雷斯这两位 30 多岁的记者穿的 T 恤上还展示着他的笑容，他戴着眼镜或他标志性的巴拿马草帽。
One can sense his absence even as he remains everywhere – a massive photograph on the front of Riodoce’s office building shows Valdíz giving the middle finger, with the caption “Justicia”; a T-shirt worn by two 30-something reporters, Aarón Iván and Miriam Ramírez, features his smile, with him either in glasses or with his signature Panama hat.
One can sense deeply how much he is missed, even as he is everywhere – a giant poster of Valdez standing in a V for Victory pose hangs on the wall of the Riodoce office, with the caption “Justicia” or “Justice”; a T-shirt worn by Alan Herrera and Mireya Ramirez, two 30-something journalists, displays his smile, captured with glasses or his signature Panama hat.

即使如此，即使瓦尔迪兹深刻知道这份工作的危险性，但 60 岁的《Riodoce》联合创始人兼董事伊斯梅尔·波荷奎还是因为没有保护好他的朋友而愧疚不已。
Still, even as Valdíz knows the danger of the work, Ismael Pozoqui, the 60-year-old co-founder of and director for Riodoce, said he felt guilty for failing to protect his friend.

This report might have enraged the sons; the paper was bought up by suspected gang members the moment it hit the newsstand.
This report might have enraged the sons, and newspaper boxes are known to be bought off by gang members.
第二个错误是在另一份报道同一个故事的报纸被没收后没有强迫瓦尔迪兹为自身安全考虑离开墨西哥。

A second mistake is not forcing Valdez out of Mexico after seizing a newspaper that reported the same story.
波荷奎说，在锡那罗州，“踏足新闻业不可能不跟毒品问题打交道。”

波荷奎说，“他们不喜欢你给他们的女人和孩子惹麻烦，也不喜欢你影响他们的合法公司和用于运送毒品的秘密机场。
"They didn't like you causing trouble for their women and children, or interfering with their legitimate businesses and secret airfields used to transport drugs," he said.

As a result, you need to maintain a very high level of self-censorship and self-protection even in the safest of times.

如果你嗅到了危险的气息，赶紧远离。
If you smell something dangerous, get away immediately.
Get away fast if you smell the danger.
他和其他人都说以前的规则已不再适用于锡那罗州——就像已经不再适用于塔毛利帕斯州、韦拉克鲁斯州、格雷罗州和其他州一样，这些州的走私路线利润丰厚，而各机构势微，政府官员腐败，乌烟瘴气。
Both he and others say the old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa - just as the old rules don't apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and elsewhere where the smuggling routes are profitable and the agencies weak, the officials corrupt and the atmosphere foul.

and an abduction in the upscale restaurant of Culliacan, which is just one street block away from the prosecutor's office.
and an abduction in the upscale restaurant of Cullen, just one block from the prosecutor’s office.
官方并没有发布被绑架对象和绑架过程的信息，因此写下这个城市都知道的事情时需要慎之又慎：那就是这家餐厅是毒贩和官方都爱去的地方。
No information was provided about the kidnapping victim or the circumstances of the abduction, which prompted some restraint in describing what is known in the city: that the restaurant is frequented by drug traffickers and by the authorities.
No information about the subject of the abduction or the method used was released by the authorities, so be warned that this is a restaurant that is loved by both drug traffickers and officials:

但与此同时，有望突破万亿规模的自驾游市场却也面临着双重挑战。
However, at the same time, there are twofold challenges in the self-guided travel market which is expected to exceed 10 trillion yuan.
However, at the same time, there are two challenges that need to be overcome in order to break through the 1 trillion market.
占国内游总人次60％，市场规模有望破万亿
It accounts for 60% of total number of inland tourists and its market size is expected to exceed RMB 1 trillion.
With 60% of the total domestic tourist, the market scale may exceed 1 trillion yuan
2016年全年国内旅游44．4亿人次，自驾游占据国内旅游总人次的60％左右，到2020年自驾游市场规模有望突破万亿。
In 2016, there were 4.44 billion domestic tourist arrivals. Self-driving tours accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourist arrivals, and the scale of the self-driving tour market is expected to exceed 1 trillion by 2020.
The number of domestic tourism amounted to 4.44 billion person times in 2016, accounting for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourism; and it is expected that the scale of the self-driving tourism market will break through 1 trillion yuan by 2020.
自驾游俱乐部盈利微薄，完整产业链是关键
The profits of self-driving tour clubs are meager, and the complete industry chain is the key.
Car camping club is making a small profit, complete industry chain is key
北京行天下汽车俱乐部创始人兼CEO李冠杰认为自驾游俱乐部本质上和旅行社是类似的，早期的主要盈利模式都是以线下活动为主，核心点是自驾游线路产品和领队服务。
According to Lee Kangjie, the founder and CEO of the Beijing Hengtianxia Automobile Club, the nature of self-driving travel clubs is similar to travel agencies. In the early days, the main source of profit was mainly offline activities; the core was the self-driving travel route products and driver service.
According to Lee Kangjie, the founder and CEO of the China RV Car Club, the nature of RV clubs is similar to travel agencies; the main profit model of the early era is mainly online; the core is the product of RV itinerary and tour guide services.
可以看出，自驾游本身并不是一个独立的产业，而是以其自驾游的位移特点形成了一个跨地域、行业的生态圈，形成完整的产业链十分重要。
As we can see, self driving is not a standalone industry, but a cross-regional and cross-industry ecological circle based on the location and movement characteristics of self driving. Thus, forming a complete industry chain is crucial.
It is noteworthy that self-driving tour is not an independent industry, but it is an ecological circle with cross-regional and industry features, and the formation of a complete industrial chain is critical.
风景道不仅是道路，汽车营地不应只满足食宿
Scenic byways are not just roadways, and RV parks shouldn’t just be places to rest and refuel.
Scenic byway not just about roadway, campground shouldn’t be limited to sleep and eat
李冠杰指出，旅游风景道不只是一条路而已，而是需要将交通跟旅游的元素都融合在里面，但是修公路和做旅游本身是两个部门来负责，交通部门增加旅游元素，也还停留在建设厕所、咨询中心、宣传栏等设施，与旅游的结合度还不高。
According to Li Guangjie, the scenic highway is not just a road; rather it needs to integrate transportation and tourism elements. However, the construction of roads and the tourism industry itself are managed by two different departments; the integration of tourism elements into the construction of roads is still limited to building toilets, consultation centers, and advertising boards, and the integration with tourism is not high.
According to Li Guangjie, the scenic route is not just a road, but an integrated form of transportation and tourism; however, the construction of roads and the development of tourism are two different departments; when the traffic department adds the elements of tourism, such as restrooms, consultation centers, information bars, etc., the combination of transportation and tourism still isn’t that high.
他们认为，很多营地偏向于基础建设，只能满足吃住，档次不高，产品单一，无法满足自驾游这种包含很多元素的需求。
In their opinion, many of these campgrounds focus more on basic infrastructure and only offer basic living facilities, with low quality, simple product offerings that are not capable of meeting the diverse needs of RV travel.

Despite the fact that anti-glazing is common, the results of the discovery are surprising, because the dinosaur is far larger than any existing animals using anti-glazing.
Despite the fact that antiscale is common, the results were surprising because the size of the dinosaur was far beyond the available animals that applied anti-scale techniques.
这种恐龙面临被肉食恐龙猎杀的压力，从而朝有利的方向进化，使其能够在对垒中隐藏起来，以此作为生存的手段。
Such dinosaurs were under the threat of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, and thus evolved in a favorable direction, making them able to hide during confrontation and thus use this as a means of survival.
Such dinosaurs were under the threat of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, which drove them to evolve in a way that was advantageous, allowing them to hide to survive.
但是，现存的大多数采用反荫蔽术的动物，比如鹿，斑马或者犰狳等，都像猎物一样小和脆弱，这表明该生物面临着真正的生存压力。
But the fact that the majority of existing animals that use antipredatory tactics, such as deer, zebras or gazelles, are small and frail, much like prey, suggests that the species faces genuine survival pressure.

布朗说：“这种结节龙真正令人惊叹，因为它被保存的鳞状皮肤完全覆盖，而且，至今被保存在维空间里，从而使其原始形状得以保存。”
Brown said: 'This nodosaur is really remarkable because it's entirely covered in preserved scaly skin and because, so far, it's preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original shape.'
Brown said: 'The coelurosaur really is astonishing because it is completely covered in preserved skin and scales, and in addition it is so preserved in space that its original shape is preserved.'
最新研究发现出现在《当代生物学》杂志上的科学家们相信，结节龙死后被冲到海里，之后在泥土中形成了木乃伊。
A recent study published in Current Biology found that scientists believe that after the nodosaur died, it was washed out to the sea, where it was then mummified in mud.

正如迈克尔?格瑞斯考 (Michael Greshko) 在《国家地理》杂志上所写的那样，这种保存程度就像中彩一样，是十分罕见的。
The level of preservation, as National Geographic writer Michael Greshko wrote, is like a winning Powerball ticket - it's incredibly rare.

2014 年 8 月 9 日，布列塔尼·费雷尔内心惶惑不安。
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was nervous and anxious inside.

上面写道“警察刚杀死一个 18 岁的孩子，孩子还躺在街上”。
It read: "Police have just killed an 18 year old boy, he is lying in the road."
"The cops just killed a 18 year old kid laying in the street."
她发现馈送信息上没有其他人发布这条信息，她感到很困惑。她关了脸谱网，打开推特。
Confused that no one else had posted about it on the feed, she closed Facebook and went to Twitter.
Confused by the lack of engagement on the post, she closed down Facebook and opened up Twitter.

He posted a picture of the body of Mr Brown lying in the street with no signs of life – and the body remained on the road for four hours.
He posted a picture of Brown lying on the street showing signs of having lost his life and his body was left there for four hours.
“疯了，”费雷尔心想。
"I've gone mad," Ferrell thought.
"I've lost it," Ferrer thought.
她放下手机，直到当天晚上才再次打开推特，读到关于坎菲尔德大道众人聚集的推文。
She set her phone down and did not return to Twitter until later that night, when she read a tweet about the gathering on Canfield Avenue.
She set her phone down and did not return until that evening to find tweets about the gathering on Canfield Drive.
那一刻，我感到不寒而栗。
At that moment, I felt a chill down my spine.
I felt sick at that moment.
在接下来的三年里，费雷尔和弗格森发生了什么事情，就是 8 月 11 日在影院上映的一部新纪录片“谁的街道？”的主题。
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the topic of the new documentary, “Whose Streets?” which premieres in theaters Aug. 11.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the topic of the new documentary, “Who Let the Dogs Out?,” opening Aug. 11 in theaters.
这是一个有关从居住在这个社区、挤满大街小巷要求获得答案的人们的角度，讲述生存和抗议、爱和失落、力量和坚韧的故事。
It is a story of survival, protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of the people living in the community who have been clamoring for answers.
It is a story of survival, protest, love and loss, told from the perspectives of people living in this community, packed into the streets demanding answers.
我不得不带上她，”费雷尔后来说。
I had to bring her along,” Ferrell said later.

费雷尔和她女儿与一位做袋装午餐的当地企业老板联系上。
Ferril and her daughter reached out to a local business owner who makes bagged lunches.
Ferril reached out to a local entrepreneur who packages lunches. She and her daughter started eating his food.
她说道，“我的激进主义在 8 月 9 日之后彻底改变了。”在密苏里州立大学圣路易斯分校就读本科时，她是少数民族护士生协会主席，关注黑人社区的粮食正义与健康差距问题。
"My activism had completely changed since August 9th," she said. While attending Saint Louis University, she was president of the Minority Nursing Students Association and was interested in issues of food justice and disparities in health for black communities.
"My radicalization changed completely after Aug. 9," she said, noting that as the president of a student group that focuses on food justice and health disparities affecting black communities at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she has been active in the fight for the rights of the black community.
几周之后，费雷尔在一场夜间游行中与影片联合导演萨巴赫·福莱扬会面。
A few weeks later, Farrelly met with co-director of the film, Sacha Fletcher, during a nighttime rally.
A few weeks later, Farrell met with co-director on the film SahabzadehFarookhan Fyzee during a nighttime parade.
这种怀疑来源于很多这种案例：人们 - 通常是白人 - 进入一个社区，以从其痛苦和坚韧中获得利益。
The mistrust stems from many cases in which people – usually whites – move into communities to profit from their suffering and resilience.
The mistrust stems from many cases in which people – usually whites – move into communities to profit from their suffering.
正如福莱扬在最近一次采访中所解释的那样，“我们听说在弗格森土生土长的人们没有集中他们的声音，而我们想要以不同的方式去做。”
"We heard that the voices of people who grew up in Ferguson were not being heard, and we wanted to do something different," Ferguson explained in a recent interview.
"We heard the Fersons, who are natives of Ferguson, weren't amplifying their voices and we wanted to do something different," Folayan explained in the interview.
福莱扬已经与联合导演戴蒙·戴维斯联系上。戴蒙·戴维斯是一位以针对死囚犯的激进主义而闻名的地区艺术家。
Foley has already reached out to co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism on behalf of death row inmates.
Foley has already reached out to Damon Davis, a local artist known for his militant activism on behalf of death row inmates.
结果，“谁的街道？”令人惊讶地记录了费雷尔的个人生活，比如坠入爱河、步入结婚。
The result, “Whose Street?,” surprisingly documents Ferrell’s personal life, such as falling in love, and getting married.
The result, “Whose Street?,” surprisingly documents Ferrell’s personal life, such as falling in love, and walking down the aisle.
“我感觉自己赤裸裸的，”费雷尔第一次看到成品时大笑起来。
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell laughed, when she first saw the finished product.
"I was just naked," Ferris said with a laugh the first time she saw a finished product.
“但我明白，做这项工作并将黑人人性化，必须要有一定程度的脆弱性。”
"But I understand that to do the work that we're doing and to humanize black people, you have to have a certain level of vulnerability.
"But I understand that to do the work that we're doing and to humanize the black experience, you have to be somewhat vulnerable."
此外，费雷尔的故事重申并重新定位了黑人酷儿女性在更广泛的黑人生活事件运动中的角色。
Moreover, the Ferrell story reiterates and repositions the role of Black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Moreover, the Ferrel story, in essence, is a reaffirmation and redefinition of the roles of black butch females within the larger black lives matter movement.
该运动三位创始人中的两位 -- 在 2012 年黑人青少年特雷沃恩·马丁枪击案之后在社交媒体上创造了#BlackLivesMatter -- 被认定为酷儿。
Two of the movement’s founders, whose #BlackLivesMatter hashtag went viral on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of a black teenager named Trayvon Martin, have been identified as queer.

“她是激发这种能量的人，”她说。

事实上，十年之前网络上就已经提供在线翻译服务了，而其实在很早以前，关于“机器即将替代人类进行翻译”的论调就不绝于耳。
Actually, online translation services have been available on the Internet for more than ten years. In fact, a long time ago, many people said that “machines would replace humans to make translations”.

相似之处：艺术家使用切尔西?曼宁 (Chelsea Manning) 的 DNA 创作肖像
What's the same: Artists create portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
What it means: Artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portrait
这30幅肖像画是由艺术家希瑟?杜威?哈格堡 (Dewey-Hagborg) 使用切尔西?曼宁寄给她的脸颊棉签和头发碎屑进行创作的。
These 30 portrait paintings were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg who used cheek swabs and hair clippings that Charlize Manning sent her.
These 30 portrait images were created by artist Hani Dewey-Hagborg using cotton swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chalotte Maning.
曼宁从利文沃斯堡监狱寄出头发碎屑，因通过维基解密网站泄露了机密外交电报，该名前情报分析人员被判处在此服刑35年。
Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified diplomatic cables via WikiLeaks, mailed off locks of hair from the prison.
Manning, who was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks, shipped off the shaved hair in bits from the prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
通过从曼宁的 DNA 进行算法分析，并且以此创建了“很可能出现的外表”的 30 幅肖像。希瑟杜威·哈博格以此做出了一个尖刻又略有点无情的评论。他的评论既是对于 DNA 的多意性的，也是对于身份这一概念本身的。
By analyzing Manning’s DNA with algorithms, a set of 30 portraits were created called “Most Likely Appearance.” Heather Dewey-Hagborg gave a sharp and somewhat heartless review of this, one that commented on the ambiguity of DNA as well as the concept of identity.
By analyzing Manning’s DNA and then creating a 30-person composite of “the looks that are most likely” to be his, Hayhurst made a pointed and somewhat unkind commentary on the malleability of DNA and the concept of identity itself.
在狱中，她的形象是被抑制的，只有一张照片，具有颗粒感的黑白自拍照，看起来明显的不安，坐在驾驶座上，戴着铂金色的假发。
In prison, her image has been subdued, with just one photograph, a grainy black-and-white selfie that looks distinctly uncomfortable, perched on a driver's seat with a platinum blonde wig.
In prison, she looks subdued, a picture of one, the grainy black and white selfie revealing a distinct sense of unease, sitting behind the wheel, wearing a false gold.
2015 年，希瑟杜威·哈博格在她 2012 年的项目《陌生人的脸 (Stranger Visions) 》中取得了巨大的成功。
In 2015, Heather Dewey-Hagborg achieved great success with her 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In 2015, Heder DuVernay Harbor made great progress in her 2012 project “Stranger Visions.”
那件作品中，她使用从烟蒂和口香糖中等法院物证,从碎屑中提取到的 DNA，创建可能相似长相的 3D 人物肖像。
In that piece, she used DNA extracted from court evidence such as cigarette butts and gum to create 3D portraits of people who may have had a similar appearance.
In that piece, she created 3D likenesses of possible lookalikes, using cigarette butts and pieces of DNA extracted from gumshields as forensic evidence.
当时切尔西·曼宁不能参观，也不能拍照，所以他们联系切尔西，询问她是否有兴趣制作 DNA 肖像。
Chelsea Manning was unable to attend or take photos at the time, so they reached out to her and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait.
Chelcee Grimes was unable to make it to the event or take pictures, so they got in touch with Chelcee to see if she was interested in doing a DNA portrait.
他们甚至创作了一本漫画书《压抑的头像》，由 Shoili Kanungo 所绘制。该漫画书预想总统将来可以对曼宁准许特权，她能够在狱中看到展览。
They have even created a graphic novel, "The Suppressed Portrait," by Shoili Kanungo, which imagines the president allowing Manning privileges so that she can view exhibits in prison.
They have even created a graphic book, "The Caged Portrait," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, envisioning that the President could grant the privilege to Manney, to watch exhibitions in jail.
而奥巴马就在书出版后的几天要求将她获释。这或许是一场机缘巧合，当时曼宁在堪萨斯军事监狱正好度过了第七个年头。
And Obama had just requested her release days before her book came out - perhaps an odd bit of coincidence as Manning had been spending her seventh year in the military prison in Kansas.
And Obama had just requested her release days before her book came out - perhaps an odd bit of coincidence as Manning had been in Kuwait detention for exactly seven years.
当被问及这一切特殊的时机，希瑟杜威·哈博格说，“任何事情的发生都有原因”。
Asked about the special timing of it all, Hegberg said, "Everything happens for a reason."
Asked about all this serendipity, Ms. Haborog said, "Everything happens for a reason."
在画廊墙上写下的艺术家声明中，曼宁的超大号签名在下面 (名字中的“i”用一颗心来画出来) ，呼吁结束“以性别、性取向和文化为基础的党派之争乱像。”
In a statement by the artist written on a gallery wall, Manning's oversize signature below (the "i" in the name drawn with a heart) calls for an end to "party bickering based on sex, gender and cultural identity."
In a statement by the artist written on a gallery wall, Manning's oversize signature is emblazoned below (with hearts for the "i"s in her name) and calls for the end of "gender and sexuality-based tribalism."
对面墙上是她的线粒体DNA序列,用铅笔扭扭曲曲写着 Cs、Gs 和 As 符号。
Her mitochondrial DNA sequence was written across the opposite wall, in curly cursive, with Cs, Gs and As symbols.
The opposite wall held her mitochondrial DNA sequence, scrawled in ballpoint pen in Cs, Gs and As symbols.
通过包含 200 个字母 (或核苷酸，每个艺术家复杂的科学词典) ，希瑟杜威·哈博格希望通过描绘出这些出奇相似的肖像，表达出至少在生理结构上，人人都是这样的。
With 200 letters (or nucleotides - a scientist's complex dictionary for each artist), Heather Dewey-Hagborg wants to express that, at least on the physiological level, everyone is like this, as she depicts portraits that are so similar to each other.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides - a scientist's complex dictionary of each artist) Heather Dewey-Hagborg hopes to express that, at least in terms of physical structure, we are all very much the same.
“我希望人们摆脱这种困境，我们的基因组不会关心我们是谁，公开的基因数据是如何解读的，它是多么的主观 ”，希瑟杜威·哈博格说，他的 2007 年的录像作品《虚假记忆》也在展出。
“I hope that people get over that and our genome doesn't care who we are, and how the public genetic data is read, and how subjective it is, ” Høeg says, noting that his 2007 video work, “False Memory,” is also on display.
“I hope that people get over that and our genome doesn't care who we are, and how the open data on the genome is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Hilde Durieux, whose 2007 video work, "False Memory," is also on view.
展览中的最后一幅作品，在一个房间内，来自前面插图中篇小说中的一页。
The last piece of the exhibition is a page from a short story from the preceding picture book located in one room.
The last piece of art in the exhibition is housed in a room from a page in the novella which was previously the frontispiece.

Manning is seen in a video with a microphone held by an American soldier, exaggerating his gestures and body language in the shape of a diamond.
Manning is seen in a video with a microphone held by an American soldier floating and made of gold.
“我就是再害怕，我依然要说出的。”
"Even if I am afraid, I still have to say it. "
"I am as scared as it gets and I will still say it."
曼宁还没有亲自看过这个展览，正如漫画中那么预见的那样，但是当她这样做的时候，她将由她自己的 DNA 肖像面具，就像一群抗议者在展馆中心获得欢呼。
Manning hasn’t yet seen the exhibit herself—just as predictable as the comic book suggests, but when she does, she will be greeted by her own DNA portrait mask, like a chorus of protesters at the center of the gallery.
Manning hasn’t yet seen the exhibit herself—just as predictable as the comic book suggests, but when she does, she will be greeted by a ghostly face mask of her own DNA, just like the cheering group of protesters at the center of the gallery.
这也是有目的的，正如展览中的所有物品一样，都达到了她用铅笔写成的遗传单倍群信息的高度 (5.2 英尺，曼宁的身高) 。
It is also intentional; as all the items in the exhibit are positioned to match the height of her DNA profile, written in pencil (5.2 feet, Manning’s height).
It is also intentional; as all the items on display, they reach the height of her handwritten pedigree DNA information (5.2 feet, Mennin's height) in pencil.
“但我想让它们感觉像是一群跟随着切尔西的抗议者，正如当时人们抗议要释放她一样。”
But I want to give the impression that they are following in the footsteps of the Chelsea protesters who were demanding her release.
But I want to give the impression that they are following the Charleston protesters, as people were protesting to have her released.'

当今商业竞争只会越来越激烈，如何在同质化严重的市场中杀出一条血路，夺得未来消费者心中的“购物圣地”的美誉，值得所有的房地产开发商去认真思考。
Today, business competition is only getting more intense, and it’s important for all real estate developers to seriously consider how to stand out in a highly saturated market and gain a reputation as a “shopping paradise” among consumers in the future.
Today, business competition is only getting more intense, and it’s worth paying careful attention to how we can pave a path of success in a fiercely homogenous market, win the recognition of “shopping paradise” in the hearts of future consumers, and do it in a way that is worthy of all real estate developers.
单单只凭差异化战略是远远不够的，只有那些真真正正地将消费者放在心中，急消费者所急，想消费者所想，给消费者提供极致而又简约的购物体验的开发商才能在暴风雨来临的市场中笑傲江湖。
Simply having differentiation strategies are not enough, and developers that truly place the consumer in their heart, urgently meet the consumer's needs, think about the consumer's desires, and provide consumers with ultimate yet simple shopping experiences will be able to reign in the market during the storm.

当然，到最后我想最高兴的还是重庆的子民，拥有这么好的购物体验和商圈，放在10年前没人能够想象今日的繁华。
And, of course, I think the happiest people are the people of Chongqing, who have such great shopping experiences and business districts. No one could have imagined today’s prosperity 10 years ago.
And, of course, I think I’m most excited for Chongqing people, who have such a good shopping experience and a shopping district that nobody could have imagined 10 years ago with today’s prosperity.

十年前没人会想到，11月11日单身青年出于自嘲创造的“光棍节”亚文化会被电商收编，成为如今现象级的“双11”购物狂欢节。
No one would have thought ten years ago that the "Singles Day" subculture created by young bachelors as a self-mockery on November 11 would be assimilated by e-commerce companies and become the phenomenal "Double 11" shopping carnival today.

2009年11月11日，阿里巴巴第一次使用“光棍节大促销”的营销噱头：没人跟你谈恋爱，那么“单身狗”们快来网购吧。

张冬方：在德国拉开的移动支付战局不具期待性。
Zhang Dongfang: The scenario of the mobile payment war that opens in Germany is not very promising.
Zheng Dongfang: It is not hopeful for the development of mobile payment in Germany.
微信支付和支付宝不过把战场搬到了欧洲，竞争对手没变，抢夺阵地也没变——中国人，这也算全球化？
WeChat Pay and Alipay just moved the battlefield to Europe. The rivals have not changed, and the objective has not changed – the Chinese people. Does that also count as globalization?
WeChat Pay and Alibaba just moved the battlefield to Europe; the competitors haven’t changed, and we still want to grab land; the Chinese, this can also be called globalization?
有支付宝的地方，必有微信支付。
Wherever there is Alipay, there must be WeChat Pay.
There are WeChat payments everywhere there is Alipay.
按照和德国电子支付服务商Wirecard的协议，微信支付今年11月正式着手落地德国，并逐渐在欧洲范围内的商家进行布局。
According to the agreement between WeChat Pay and Germany’s electronic payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay formally set foot in Germany in November this year and gradually deployed across merchants in Europe.
According to the agreement between Alipay and Wirecard, a German electronic payment service provider, Alipay formally started the landing operation in Germany in November of this year, and gradually carried out the layout of the merchants in Europe.

对于中国的移动支付的全球化方式，艾瑞咨询《中国第三方移动支付行业研究报告2017》总结为两种：一是通过战略投资，经验输出，入股并扶持国外本土移动支付企业。

确实，得中国人得天下。
It’s really true that if you’ve got the Chinese, you’ve got the world.
It’s really true, whoever gets China gets the world.
中国经济发展迅猛，再加上人口基数大，中国游客在欧洲的花销是一个诱人的数字。
With China's rapid economic growth and a large population base, spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
With its fast-growing economy and large population, Chinese tourists are a tempting demographic to European tourism destinations.
但这也注定了，这次在德国拉开的中国移动支付战局不具期待性。
But this also meant that the Chinese mobile payment battle that started in Germany lacked any promise.
But this also meant that this time, when it came to the mobile payment war in Germany, there was no prospect.
更具开拓性的探讨是，中国的移动支付能否在欧洲本土开疆拓土？
A more pioneering discussion is whether China’s mobile payment can gain ground in Europe?
More pioneering discussion is that China’s mobile payments can make a foothold in Europe itself?
以德国为例。
Take Germany as an example.
For example, take Germany.
被施了魔法的“新零售”
“New retail” under the spell of magic
“New retail” that has been cast a spell
陈歆磊、杨凯涵：亚马逊在挤进全球十大零售商时候宣布进军书店和杂货铺，不论时机还是动机都很值得玩味。
