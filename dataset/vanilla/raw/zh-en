在北京奥运会到伦敦奥运会期间，英国队的问题在于换掉了“第一圈专家”杰米·斯塔夫。
During the period from Beijing to London Olympics, the problem of the British team was that it replaced Jamie Stafford, the "first circle expert".	0.7686641216278076

Sinkin was joined by Cindy and Kenny, who had won gold together with Hoy four years ago. The three broke the Olympic record in the qualification round, but this result was surpassed in the first round by the New Zealand team.	0.7566536068916321

Although Cindy was slightly behind, Kenny got the team ahead, and Squiggy held this lead until the end.	0.7043259143829346

市场人士指出，近段时间，欧洲央行货币政策收紧预期推升欧元汇率，美元指数连续下滑，人民币对美元汇率相应出现一波快速拉升行情，不过目前看，欧洲央行不太可能很快调整政策立场，外汇市场短期波动后终究要向基本面回归，人民币汇率继续平稳运行是大概率事件。
Market analysts pointed out that in recent time, the expectation of the tightening of monetary policy by the European Central Bank has increased the exchange rate of the euro, and the US dollar index has continued to fall, resulting in a rapid rising trend of the exchange rate of the renminbi against the US dollar; however, at present, it is unlikely that the European Central Bank will adjust its policy position soon; after short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, the renminbi exchange rate will eventually return to its fundamental factors, and the continuation of the stable operation of the renminbi exchange rate is a high-probability event.	0.8097041249275208
Market participants pointed out that in recent times, the Euro has been pushed up by the expectation of the ECB’s monetary tightening; and under this expectation, the U.S. dollar index has fallen. The People’s Bank of China has promptly raised the exchange rate of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Currently, the ECB is unlikely to adjust its policy stance soon, and after short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate of the Renminbi will eventually return to the fundamentals, and the exchange rate of the Renminbi will continue to operate stably.	0.7132476568222046

The Bank of England has warned that the economy will continue to grow “sluggishly” as it tightens up on mortgage borrowing while keeping a lid on interest rates.	0.7739086151123047
但其表示在接下来的几年中，将需要上调利率以遏制脱欧带来的通货膨胀，同时借款费用可能需要以金融市场中期望的更大幅度上调。
But it signalled that interest rates would need to rise in the coming years to rein in inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to rise by a greater margin than currently expected in financial markets.	0.8100268244743347
It did, however, say that in the years ahead, rates will need to be raised to curb inflation from Brexit, while borrowing costs may need to rise by an even larger degree than market expectations indicate over the medium term.	0.7601704597473145

在利率决策会议记录中，英格兰银行称：“在 MPC 的核心预测中，国内生产总值 (GDP) 在近期依然呈疲软之势，因为家庭实际收入紧缩将继续压制消费。”
In its minutes from its interest rate decision meeting, the Bank of England said: 'Overall, in the MPC's central forecast, GDP continues to grow relatively slowly in the short term as consumption is squeezed by ongoing tightening in real household disposable income.'	0.8209450244903564
The Bank said in the minutes of its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting: "The central projection for GDP growth was little changed from previous months, but was still relatively weak, with consumption continuing to be constrained by tightening real incomes."	0.7755239605903625

该决策制定之前一年，令人震惊的欧盟全民公投让英镑暴跌，八月份利率下调至 0.25%。
One year before the decision, a shock Brexit vote saw the pound tumble and interest rates cut to 0.25%.	0.7956761121749878
This comes a year after a shock referendum saw the pound crash and the Bank of England cut rates to 0.25%.	0.7386658191680908
在该行公布其最新利率裁定之前，利率上调的呼声就不绝于耳，因为通货膨胀令早已倍感压力的普通家庭雪上加霜，同时三位决策者呼吁 7 月份将利率上调至 0.5%。
Rates had been mooted ahead of the Fed's announcement of its latest rate decision as inflation had pushed already-strained households to breaking point, while three policymakers called for the key rate to be raised to 0.5 per cent in July.	0.7572413682937622
The Fed is already under fire for doing too little, with rates seen as too low to combat inflation that is pushing hard-pressed households to the limit, while three of the Fed's policymakers have called for a rate increase to 0.5% in July.	0.6814301013946533
该行称相对其 2% 的目标，超过的部分已经完全是疲软的英镑最后的底线了。

这间公寓位于一个优雅的安妮女王式露台的一楼 -- 乔安妮没有收拾行李将其出售，这就是对新设计的有力证明。

Late in February, a copy of an article on GotNews.com, a website of the network provocateur Charles C.
