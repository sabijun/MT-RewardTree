上一个死去的是他们的编辑和灵感来源，同时也是《Riodoce》的联合创始人哈维尔·瓦尔迪兹·卡德纳斯。
Last killed was their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdés Cadenas, also co-founder of Riodoce.
The last was their editor and a source of inspiration, also the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdés Cadena.
瓦尔迪兹写过很多关于毒品暴力的书籍，他在其中一本中这样写道：“最大的错误就是住在墨西哥并成为一个记者。”
Valdez, who has written several books about drug violence, wrote in one of them, “The biggest mistake was to live in Mexico and become a journalist.”
Warrant wrote several books on the drug violence, and in one of them, he wrote: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist."
大家能够深切感觉到他已经离开，虽然他无处不在——一张巨大的照片挂在《Riodoce》办公楼的正面，瓦尔迪兹竖着中指，配词“正义”；亚伦·伊瓦拉和米里亚姆·拉米雷斯这两位 30 多岁的记者穿的 T 恤上还展示着他的笑容，他戴着眼镜或他标志性的巴拿马草帽。
You can feel deeply how he's already gone, even though he's everywhere—the huge photo on the front of Riodoce's office building shows Valdiz with his middle finger up, the caption saying "justice"; the T-shirts worn by the two 30-something reporters, Aarón Iván López and Miriam Ramírez, also show his smile, with him either wearing glasses or his signature Panama hat.
People could feel deeply his absence, though he was everywhere—a giant photograph of Valdízz on the front of the Riodoce offices with his middle finger up, the word “justice” above him; a T-shirt worn by Aarón Iván Pérez or Miriam Lamadrid, both over 30 and journalists, with his grinning face; or he was in his glasses or in his trademark Panama hat.
在《Riodoce》，他们坚持报道锡那罗州的暴力事件，虽然他们已经心碎，虽然这片土地已千疮百孔。

They continued to cover violent incidents in Sinaloa, though broken-hearted and though the land was ruined.

But in terms of Valdez, there’s actually not much more than silence.
锡那罗州的街道上每天都有一个或几个人被枪杀，墓地里布满了毒枭华丽的两层陵墓，这些已经司空见惯。

Shootings occur daily on the streets of Sinaloa state, as do the drug lord’s gaudy double-height tombs in the cemetery, and nothing can be done.
即使如此，即使瓦尔迪兹深刻知道这份工作的危险性，但 60 岁的《Riodoce》联合创始人兼董事伊斯梅尔·波荷奎还是因为没有保护好他的朋友而愧疚不已。
And even as Valdez understands the risks of this work, Ismael Porhuqui, 60, the co-founder and director of Riodoce, is haunted by the fact that he failed to protect his friend.
Even so, and despite knowing the dangers of the job, Ismail Póquer, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, felt guilty for not having protected his friend.

First, the interviews with Damaso López were published in February; he leads a cartel group fighting against Guzmán’s sons.
First, the publication of the interview with Dámaso López, the leader of a cartel that fights against Gúzman’s sons, in February
这份报道可能激怒了这几个儿子；报纸一送到报摊就被嫌疑帮派成员买断。
The story was likely to have angered the sons; the newspaper was bought up by members of a feared gang.
The story could have incited the sons; the paper was bought off by a suspected gang.
第二个错误是在另一份报道同一个故事的报纸被没收后没有强迫瓦尔迪兹为自身安全考虑离开墨西哥。
The second mistake was failing to force Valdez to leave Mexico for his own safety after newspapers reporting the same story were confiscated.
The second mistake was that he did not leave Mexico for its own safety when the newspaper which had run the story was seized.
波荷奎说，在锡那罗州，“踏足新闻业不可能不跟毒品问题打交道。”

波荷奎说，“他们不喜欢你给他们的女人和孩子惹麻烦，也不喜欢你影响他们的合法公司和用于运送毒品的秘密机场。
"They didn't like you bothering their women and children, or interfering with their legitimate businesses and secret airfields used to transport drugs," said Bouchard.
"They don't like you making trouble for their women and children," Borders said. "They don't like you interfering with their legitimate businesses and their secret airports for moving drugs."

When you smell danger, you better back away.
他和其他人都说以前的规则已不再适用于锡那罗州——就像已经不再适用于塔毛利帕斯州、韦拉克鲁斯州、格雷罗州和其他州一样，这些州的走私路线利润丰厚，而各机构势微，政府官员腐败，乌烟瘴气。
Both he and others have said the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they no longer apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with lucrative smuggling routes and weak institutions and corrupt officials.
He and others argued that the old rules no longer applied in Sinaloa — just as they no longer apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and elsewhere, where the cartels run lucrative smuggling routes that often feature corruption and decaying institutions.
在《Riodoce》员工参加安全培训的房间里，突然就不允许使用手机；几天前，据称仅出售给政府的间谍软件在墨西哥已经用于监视记者和活动分子。
In rooms where Riodoce staff participates in safety training, cellphones were suddenly not allowed to be used; days earlier, alleged government-only spyware was used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.

The abduction took place at Kouliakan’s upscale restaurant, which is only one block away from the prosecutor’s office.
And an abduction in the expensive Kuala Lumpur restaurant where the prosecutor had dinner just a block from his office.
官方并没有发布被绑架对象和绑架过程的信息，因此写下这个城市都知道的事情时需要慎之又慎：那就是这家餐厅是毒贩和官方都爱去的地方。
As there is no official information about the abducted persons and the abduction process, it is wise to be prudent when describing something known to everybody in the city: that is, this restaurant is a favorite spot of both drug dealers and official authorities.
With no information being released about the abductees or how it happened, this is something even the casual observer of the city knows: this restaurant was the place to go for drug traffickers and officials alike.

Viri Li, a reporter for the news program, requested that the journalists write about the incidents that happened at the scene earlier, including an incident of a son of Guzman, Mexico's top drug lord, hiding from a military attack.

波荷奎瞥了一眼站在那里护卫的警察，看他们是否警觉起来。
Poqoe glanced at the police guards standing there, seeing whether they are alert.

但与此同时，有望突破万亿规模的自驾游市场却也面临着双重挑战。
However, while the market size of self-driven tours may surpass RMB 1 trillion, there are two challenges for the market.
However, with this, the self-driving tourism market of over 100 billion yuan also faces dual challenges.
占国内游总人次60％，市场规模有望破万亿
It accounts for 60% of the total number of domestic tourists, and its market scale is expected to exceed RMB 1 trillion
The percentage of domestic tourists accounted for 60% of the total number of domestic tourists and the market scale is expected to break through one trillion.

China welcomed 4.44 billion domestic tourists in 2016, and 60% of the total number of domestic tourists traveled by car. By 2020, the market scale of self-driving tours is expected to exceed RMB 1 trillion.
自驾游俱乐部盈利微薄，完整产业链是关键
The profit of the self-drive travel clubs is meager, and the complete industry chain is the key
Self-drive tourism club is not profitable, and the complete industry chain is the key
北京行天下汽车俱乐部创始人兼CEO李冠杰认为自驾游俱乐部本质上和旅行社是类似的，早期的主要盈利模式都是以线下活动为主，核心点是自驾游线路产品和领队服务。
Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing Hengtian Chuache Automobile Club, believes that self-drive travel clubs are essentially similar to travel agencies, and the main revenue models of early self-drive travel clubs were mainly offline activities. The core points are self-drive travel route products and tour guide services.
According to Li Guanjie, the founder and CEO of Beijing Hengtianchang Automobile Club, the offline travel clubs and the online travel clubs are similar in nature, with the major sources of revenue in the early days all based on in-person activities, and the key point is the self-drive tour route product and the tour leader service.
可以看出，自驾游本身并不是一个独立的产业，而是以其自驾游的位移特点形成了一个跨地域、行业的生态圈，形成完整的产业链十分重要。
As can be seen, car tour itself is not an independent industry, but it forms an inter-regional and cross-industry ecological circle with the locational feature of car travel, and it is very important to form a complete industry chain.
It can be seen that self-driving tours themselves are not a separate industry, but formed an ecosystem across regions and industries by their characteristic of being displaced, and it is important to form a complete industrial chain.
风景道不仅是道路，汽车营地不应只满足食宿
Scenic road is not only a road; car camp should not only satisfy lodging and dining needs
Not just roads, scenic routes should not only provide food and accommodations
李冠杰指出，旅游风景道不只是一条路而已，而是需要将交通跟旅游的元素都融合在里面，但是修公路和做旅游本身是两个部门来负责，交通部门增加旅游元素，也还停留在建设厕所、咨询中心、宣传栏等设施，与旅游的结合度还不高。
Li Guanjie points out that scenic routes are not just a road, but they also need to combine transportation and tourism elements in it; however, highway construction and tourism are two different departments responsible for them; the transportation department adding tourism elements has not progressed far beyond building toilets, consultation centers, and billboards; the degree of integration with tourism is relatively low.
Li Guanjie pointed out that tourism scenic highways were not just a road, but an integrated element of transportation and tourism; but the construction of highways and tourism itself were two different departments; although the transportation department increased the tourism elements, such as constructing restrooms, consulting centers, advertisement boards, etc., it is not enough to combine tourism in the current level.
他们认为，很多营地偏向于基础建设，只能满足吃住，档次不高，产品单一，无法满足自驾游这种包含很多元素的需求。
They believe that many campsites tend to be oriented towards infrastructure and can only meet the basic needs of food, clothing, and accommodation; they are of a low standard and provide only a single product, which can not meet the needs of self-driving tourism which has many elements.
They believe that many campsites are inclined towards infrastructure, which can only provide basic necessities of eating and accommodation, and are not high in grade. The products are single, and they are unable to meet the needs of self-drive travelers who require multi-element services.

从住宿调查看，自驾游人群相对更加偏好非标准住宿。

这尊化石保存得非常完好，甚至能够断定其鳞状皮肤的颜色为红棕色。这说明它有过一些“烦恼的经历”。

Although anti-camouflaging methods are common, the results were surprising because the dinosaur’s body is much larger than any existing animals that use anti-camouflaging.
Although anti-megapithecine techniques are common, the findings are surprising as the dinosaur was much bigger than any known animal using this technique.
这种恐龙面临被肉食恐龙猎杀的压力，从而朝有利的方向进化，使其能够在对垒中隐藏起来，以此作为生存的手段。
The dinosaurs faced the pressure of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, which allowed the evolution of the species in a more advantageous direction, enabling them to hide during the confrontation as a survival strategy.
This dinosaur was under pressure of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, so it evolved in a more favorable direction, able to hide in confrontation, thereby becoming means of survival.
但是，现存的大多数采用反荫蔽术的动物，比如鹿，斑马或者犰狳等，都像猎物一样小和脆弱，这表明该生物面临着真正的生存压力。
But most animals in existence today that use countershading, such as deer, zebras, and antelopes, are small and fragile just like prey, which suggests the animal faces real survival pressure.
However, most of the existing animals, such as deer, zebras and impalas, which use anti-camouflage techniques, are small and delicate, which indicates that these animals are under real survival pressure.
“大型重甲恐龙遭受疯狂捕食表明，白垩纪的食肉恐龙是多么危险”，布朗说。
"The fact that such big armored dinosaurs were subject to frenzied feeding suggests just how dangerous meat-eating dinos were in the Cretaceous," Brown said.
"The large, armoured dinosaurs were preyed upon in a frenzy demonstrates just how dangerous Cretaceous theropods were," Brown said.
布朗说：“这种结节龙真正令人惊叹，因为它被保存的鳞状皮肤完全覆盖，而且，至今被保存在维空间里，从而使其原始形状得以保存。”
Dr Brown said: 'This nodosaur is really amazing because it's got complete preserved armour plating and it's kept intact in the vacuum of space, preserving it in the way it was in the original environment.'
"These ammonites are truly stunning, as they were fully covered with armour-like skin, and have so far been preserved in the vacuum of space, which has preserved their original form," said Brown.
最新研究发现出现在《当代生物学》杂志上的科学家们相信，结节龙死后被冲到海里，之后在泥土中形成了木乃伊。
A recent study believes that scientists published in the Contemporary Biology journal believe that the nodosaurus died on the shore, was carried away by waves, and then formed a mummy in the mud.
A new study concludes scientists writing in the journal Current Biology believe the armored dinosaur was washed out to sea and later mummified in mud after it died.
2011 年 3 月 21 日，肖恩?芬克在加拿大阿尔伯塔省麦克默里堡附近的千禧矿场挖掘到该生物。
Shawn Fenker discovered the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
Shawn Mahoney discovered the creature on March 21, 2011, while prospecting in Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.
正如迈克尔?格瑞斯考 (Michael Greshko) 在《国家地理》杂志上所写的那样，这种保存程度就像中彩一样，是十分罕见的。
The level of preservation, as National Geographic writer Michael Greshko wrote, is like hitting the lottery: It's extremely rare.
It's rare to find specimens that have been preserved this well, National Geographic's Michael Greshko wrote.
残留的皮肤化石仍然覆盖在恐龙颅骨上斑驳的盔甲之上。
The remnants of skin fossils still adorned the tattered armour plating on top of the dinosaur's skull
The remnants of skin fossil still covered the armor on top of the discolored skull.

激进主义分子如何学习回答这个问题：“谁的街道？”
How radicals learned to answer the question: Whose streets?
Here's how militants respond to the question, "Whose streets?"
2014 年 8 月 9 日，布列塔尼·费雷尔内心惶惑不安。
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was filled with anxiety.
Saturday 9 August 2014 and Brittany Ferries was at a low ebb.
上面写道“警察刚杀死一个 18 岁的孩子，孩子还躺在街上”。
The banner read "Police just killed a 18 year old boy and the boy was laying in the street."
It said "Cops just murdered a 18 year old kid laying in the street."
她发现馈送信息上没有其他人发布这条信息，她感到很困惑。她关了脸谱网，打开推特。
She found that no one else had posted the information on the feed, and she found it puzzling. She logged out of Facebook, logged into Twitter.
She found nobody else had posted the information on the platform and felt puzzled. She closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
一位 @TheePharoah 用户不断给她推送动态时报。
A @TheePharoah user reports the continuous stream of dynamic stories sent to her.
One @TheePharoah user kept sending her the news.
他贴了一张布朗失去生命体征的身体躺在街上的图片，他的尸体在街上躺了四个小时。
He put up a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, his body left to rest on the pavement for four hours.
He posted a picture of Brown lying in the street, dead in the street, his body there for four hours.
“疯了，”费雷尔心想。
"I'm crazy," Ferrell thought.
"Wacky," Ferrell thought.
她放下手机，直到当天晚上才再次打开推特，读到关于坎菲尔德大道众人聚集的推文。
She set the phone aside and only checked Twitter again that evening to read about the crowd on Canfield Avenue.
She set the phone aside and did not reopen Twitter that night, only to see Twitter explode with reports about the people gathering at Canfield Drive.
那一刻，我感到不寒而栗。
I felt chilled at that moment.
At that moment, I was cold all over.
在接下来的三年里，费雷尔和弗格森发生了什么事情，就是 8 月 11 日在影院上映的一部新纪录片“谁的街道？”的主题。
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the three years since, is the subject of the new documentary film “Whose Streets?” which opens in theaters on Aug. 11.
What happened to Ferrell and McFaul in the following three years was the theme of a new documentary film, “Whose Streets?,” released in theaters on Aug. 11.
这是一个有关从居住在这个社区、挤满大街小巷要求获得答案的人们的角度，讲述生存和抗议、爱和失落、力量和坚韧的故事。
This is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of power and tenacity, seen through the eyes of the people who call this community their home and fill its streets.
This is a story, told through the perspective of those demanding answers, who live in the community that is packed, filled with stories of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience.
我不得不带上她，”费雷尔后来说。
I had to take her along, " said Ferrell afterwards.
I had to bring her,'' Ferrell later said.
费雷尔和她女儿与一位做袋装午餐的当地企业老板联系上。
Ferrell and her daughter reached out to a local entrepreneur who does bag lunches.
Ferrell and her daughter contacted the owner of a local food company that did meal prep for bags.
她说道，“我的激进主义在 8 月 9 日之后彻底改变了。”在密苏里州立大学圣路易斯分校就读本科时，她是少数民族护士生协会主席，关注黑人社区的粮食正义与健康差距问题。
"My radicalism totally changed after August 9," she said. While an undergraduate at the Saint Louis campus of the University of Missouri, she was president of the association of ethnic minority nursing students and concerned about the issue of food justice and health disparities in the black community.
She said, "My radicalization fully changed after Aug. 9." As the president of the association of minority nursing students at the School of Medicine of St. Louis of University of Missouri, she focused on food justice and health gap of black communities in college.
几周之后，费雷尔在一场夜间游行中与影片联合导演萨巴赫·福莱扬会面。
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film’s co-director, Sacha Fletcher, at a nighttime parade.
Weeks later, Ferrell met with co-director of the film, Sabu Catelin, during an evening parade.
这种怀疑来源于很多这种案例：人们 - 通常是白人 - 进入一个社区，以从其痛苦和坚韧中获得利益。
This suspicion stems from a lot of cases where people - usually white people - move into a community to profit off of its pain and resilience.
That sense stems from a litany of such cases: That people -- usually white -- enter communities to profit from their pain and resilience.
正如福莱扬在最近一次采访中所解释的那样，“我们听说在弗格森土生土长的人们没有集中他们的声音，而我们想要以不同的方式去做。”
As Foley explained in a recent interview, "We are hearing that people born and raised in Ferguson haven't been allowed to amplify their voices, and we want to do that differently."
"People from Fegersoo - who have lived there all their lives - have not made their voices heard," Folayan explained in a recent interview, "and that is something that we want to do differently."
福莱扬已经与联合导演戴蒙·戴维斯联系上。戴蒙·戴维斯是一位以针对死囚犯的激进主义而闻名的地区艺术家。
Foley has already hooked up with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism in favor of death row inmates.
Foilan has reached out to Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his radical work with death row inmates.
结果，“谁的街道？”令人惊讶地记录了费雷尔的个人生活，比如坠入爱河、步入结婚。
So, "Who's Street?" surprisingly documented Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly captured the personal lives of Ferrell and others as they fell in love and walked down the aisle.
“我感觉自己赤裸裸的，”费雷尔第一次看到成品时大笑起来。
"I felt very naked," Ferré laughed for the first time upon seeing the finished product.
"I felt naked," Field said, laughing for the first time about the finished product.
“但我明白，做这项工作并将黑人人性化，必须要有一定程度的脆弱性。”
"But I understand that doing this work and humanizing black people requires a certain level of vulnerability."
"But I understand that to do this job and to humanize the Black body, a certain level of vulnerability is required."
此外，费雷尔的故事重申并重新定位了黑人酷儿女性在更广泛的黑人生活事件运动中的角色。
In addition, Ferrell's story reinforces and relocates the role of black queer women in the larger Black Lives Matter movement.
Furthermore, Ferrell's story reinforces and re-centers the role of black queer women in the larger movement of black lives matter.
该运动三位创始人中的两位 -- 在 2012 年黑人青少年特雷沃恩·马丁枪击案之后在社交媒体上创造了#BlackLivesMatter -- 被认定为酷儿。
Two of the three founders of the movement -- who created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin -- have been deemed to be gay.
Two of the movement’s three founders - who created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 shooting death of black teen Treyvon Martin - have been identified as lesbian.
“她是激发这种能量的人，”她说。
"She's the one who generates this energy," she said.
"She is a person who stirs that energy," she said.
通过荧幕，你可以感受到她的能量。”
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.'
You can sense the energy through the screen."
尽管如此，自从三年前走上弗格森街头时，她一直坚持自己努力铭记的圣歌。
Nevertheless, ever since she hit the pavement on Ferguson Street three years ago, she's stuck with the hymns that she's been determined to remember.
Even so, she's kept up the hymns she memorized through her efforts three years ago on Furgeson Street.
事实上，十年之前网络上就已经提供在线翻译服务了，而其实在很早以前，关于“机器即将替代人类进行翻译”的论调就不绝于耳。
In fact, online translation services have been available online for more than 10 years. However, the idea that "machines would replace humans in translations" has been around since a long time ago.
In fact, ten years ago, online translation services have already been available online. Moreover, the argument of “the machine will replace human beings for translation” was heard all the time in the early stage.
相似之处：艺术家使用切尔西?曼宁 (Chelsea Manning) 的 DNA 创作肖像
Similarities: Artists use Chelsea Manning’s DNA to create portraits
What it means: Artist creates portrait using Chelsea Manning's DNA
这30幅肖像画是由艺术家希瑟?杜威?哈格堡 (Dewey-Hagborg) 使用切尔西?曼宁寄给她的脸颊棉签和头发碎屑进行创作的。
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, using cheek swabs and hair fragments sent by Manney.
The 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who used DNA samples from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent by Munning and from DNA donated anonymously.
曼宁从利文沃斯堡监狱寄出头发碎屑，因通过维基解密网站泄露了机密外交电报，该名前情报分析人员被判处在此服刑35年。
Manning sent out strands of her hair, which were shaved at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, where she was serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
Manning is serving 35 years for leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website from the maximum-security US Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
通过从曼宁的 DNA 进行算法分析，并且以此创建了“很可能出现的外表”的 30 幅肖像。希瑟杜威·哈博格以此做出了一个尖刻又略有点无情的评论。他的评论既是对于 DNA 的多意性的，也是对于身份这一概念本身的。
Through algorithm analysis of Manning's DNA, as well as the creation of a "physical appearance that is likely to occur," 30 portraits were generated. Heather Dewar Harbaugh commented acutely, and somewhat coldly, on this: it was a commentary not only on the ambiguity of DNA, but also on the concept of identity itself.
By analyzing DNA from Manne’s father, and running algorithms on that data, 30 depictions of how he might look were produced. Hidde van Schie’s commentary on this is biting and a little bit unsympathetic – both of the DNA’s randomness and the concept of identity itself.
在狱中，她的形象是被抑制的，只有一张照片，具有颗粒感的黑白自拍照，看起来明显的不安，坐在驾驶座上，戴着铂金色的假发。
In prison, her public image is restrained. There is only one photo, a grainy black-and-white selfie that looks clearly uncomfortable, sitting in the driver’s seat with a fake, platinum blonde wig.
Behind bars, she is under wraps, with just one photograph showing a grainy black-and-white selfie that looks distinctly uneasy, sitting in the driver's seat, with a wig of platinum blonde hair.
2015 年，希瑟杜威·哈博格在她 2012 年的项目《陌生人的脸 (Stranger Visions) 》中取得了巨大的成功。
In 2015, Hetherington's 2012 project, "Stranger Visions," proved wildly successful.
In 2015, Heather Dean Jones received critical acclaim for her 2012 project, "Stranger Visions."
那件作品中，她使用从烟蒂和口香糖中等法院物证,从碎屑中提取到的 DNA，创建可能相似长相的 3D 人物肖像。
For that piece, she created 3D portraits of people who might look similar based on DNA extracted from cigarette butts and gum in court evidence and other detritus.
In that piece, she used DNA extracted from cigarette butts and gumshoe court evidence to create 3D portraits of faces that could be similar.
当时切尔西·曼宁不能参观，也不能拍照，所以他们联系切尔西，询问她是否有兴趣制作 DNA 肖像。
At the time Chelsea Manning wasn’t allowed to visit, or take photographs, so they reached out to Chelsea to see if she was interested in having a DNA portrait made.
At the time, Charlize couldn't visit or take a photo, so they contacted Charlize to ask if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
他们甚至创作了一本漫画书《压抑的头像》，由 Shoili Kanungo 所绘制。该漫画书预想总统将来可以对曼宁准许特权，她能够在狱中看到展览。
They have even created a comic book, "The Suppressed Portrait," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which imagines that the President might one day grant Mahnani privileged access to the prison, so she can see the exhibit.
They even created a graphic novel, "The Hidden Face," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, envisaging the President one day granting Mennin privilege access to jail to see the exhibit.
而奥巴马就在书出版后的几天要求将她获释。这或许是一场机缘巧合，当时曼宁在堪萨斯军事监狱正好度过了第七个年头。
Then, a few days after the book was published, Obama requested her release, which may be considered a coincidence since Manning had just spent her seventh year in the Kansas military prison.
Obama granted her release just days after the book was published, perhaps an ironic twist considering Manning had just spent her seventh year at Kiriri Military Prison in Kenya.
当被问及这一切特殊的时机，希瑟杜威·哈博格说，“任何事情的发生都有原因”。
When asked about the timing of it all, Heather Duhey Habegger said, "Everything happens for a reason."
When asked about the timing of all of this, Heather DuVernay Abrams said, "Everything happens for a reason."
在画廊墙上写下的艺术家声明中，曼宁的超大号签名在下面 (名字中的“i”用一颗心来画出来) ，呼吁结束“以性别、性取向和文化为基础的党派之争乱像。”
In an artist statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manne's giant signature looms in the background (the "i" is represented by a heart) and calls for an end to "partisan bullshit based on gender, sexuality, and culture."
In an artists' statement written on the gallery's wall, Mahn painted a giant version of her signature, featuring a heart over the "i" (her name), calling for the end of "this partisan squabble based on gender, sexual orientation and culture."
对面墙上是她的线粒体DNA序列,用铅笔扭扭曲曲写着 Cs、Gs 和 As 符号。
Her mitochondrial DNA sequence was on the opposite wall, scrawled in loopy handwriting with symbols for Cs, Gs and As.
Her mitochondrial DNA sequence was written in calligraphy across the opposite wall, in black marker pen, with Cs, Gs and As symbols.
通过包含 200 个字母 (或核苷酸，每个艺术家复杂的科学词典) ，希瑟杜威·哈博格希望通过描绘出这些出奇相似的肖像，表达出至少在生理结构上，人人都是这样的。
Featuring 200 letters (or nucleotides, for that matter), Heather Dewey-Hagius hopes to depict these strikingly similar portraits as representing at least a physical resemblance between us all.
Hyeres du Vivier Harbour, through a collection of 200 letters (or nucleotides, each in a complex scientific dictionary) wanted to draw, by describing the surprisingly similar portraits, that we all are at least physically the same.
“我希望人们摆脱这种困境，我们的基因组不会关心我们是谁，公开的基因数据是如何解读的，它是多么的主观 ”，希瑟杜威·哈博格说，他的 2007 年的录像作品《虚假记忆》也在展出。
"I want people to move beyond this place where our genomes don't matter and how public data is interpreted is so subjective," said Heather Dewey Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, "Fake Memories," is also on view.
"I'd like people to get out of these kinds of predicaments," Dougherty-Hobgood says, "and not have our genomes care about who we are, or how the publicly available genetic data are interpreted, how subjective that is."
展览中的最后一幅作品，在一个房间内，来自前面插图中篇小说中的一页。
The final painting in the show is in a room, lifted from a page in the novella that inspired the frontispiece.
The final piece in the exhibition is one page in length, located in one room, and comes from the first page of the short story in the illustration of the front cover.
展示了在美国的士兵手持扩音器下浮夸、金刚造型的曼宁。
Manning appeared to float, hyperbolically and cartoonishly, in front of a bullhorn, wielded by an American soldier.
It showed a Marine in Iraq, with a bullhorn held by his side, holding a gold ring, with Manning's face popping up from the surface of the ring.
“我就是再害怕，我依然要说出的。”
“I was still afraid, but I had to speak out.”
"I'm scared, but I still have to say it. "
曼宁还没有亲自看过这个展览，正如漫画中那么预见的那样，但是当她这样做的时候，她将由她自己的 DNA 肖像面具，就像一群抗议者在展馆中心获得欢呼。
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition herself, and as the comic predicts, when she does, she will be greeted by her own DNA-based mask, much like the group of protesters who took over the center of the gallery.
Manning hasn't yet seen the exhibit in person, but as predictably as the cartoon, she will, to the roar of a group of protesters in the center of the exhibition hall, by her own DNA mask.
这也是有目的的，正如展览中的所有物品一样，都达到了她用铅笔写成的遗传单倍群信息的高度 (5.2 英尺，曼宁的身高) 。
And this was intentionally so, as with all the items in the show, which are height-scaled (5.2ft or Ms Manning's height) to the genetic code she wrote in pencil.
And it's all intentional, just like every item in the exhibit, which was scaled to a DNA double helix based on Manning's height (5.2 feet).
“但我想让它们感觉像是一群跟随着切尔西的抗议者，正如当时人们抗议要释放她一样。”
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, as people protested her release at the time."
But I wanted to make it feel like there were these sort of Chelsea protesters following her, just as there were at the time when people were protesting to have her released."

And the Hudong Park Hill, close to Chongqing’s first low-density waterfront commercial circle——Risha Waterfront Commercial Circle, is surrounded by nine parks; with low density and high openness, when people shop, they are more willing to stay, linger and slowly enjoy the pleasure of shopping, and will not be rushed by the later flow of people; truly realizing the “strolling shopping”.
当今商业竞争只会越来越激烈，如何在同质化严重的市场中杀出一条血路，夺得未来消费者心中的“购物圣地”的美誉，值得所有的房地产开发商去认真思考。
As commercial competition gets more intense, all the real estate developers need to pay attention to how to stand out among the homogenized market, and how to win the title of “Shopping Paradise” in the hearts of future consumers.
With the fierce competition in today’s business, how to kill the road to survive in a heavily homogeneous market and obtain the reputation of "shopping paradise" in the hearts of future consumers, deserves serious consideration of all real estate developers.
单单只凭差异化战略是远远不够的，只有那些真真正正地将消费者放在心中，急消费者所急，想消费者所想，给消费者提供极致而又简约的购物体验的开发商才能在暴风雨来临的市场中笑傲江湖。
It is far from sufficient just to have a differentiated strategy; only developers who truly put customers in the forefront, meet the needs of customers, listen to the voice of customers, and offer customers the ultimate and simplistic shopping experience can be successful in the stormy market.
It is far from enough to adopt a differentiation strategy. Only developers who put consumers in their hearts, satisfy consumers’ urgent needs, and make consumers feel and think what they are thinking can laugh at the storm and stand out in the market.
当然，到最后我想最高兴的还是重庆的子民，拥有这么好的购物体验和商圈，放在10年前没人能够想象今日的繁华。
Of course, in the end, the people of Chongqing are the happiest. With such a great shopping experience and commercial district, no one could have imagined this prosperity 10 years ago.
Of course, I am most happy for the citizens of Chongqing. In the past, no one could have thought that this shopping mall and commercial district would have been such a delightful place to shop and visit.

十年前没人会想到，11月11日单身青年出于自嘲创造的“光棍节”亚文化会被电商收编，成为如今现象级的“双11”购物狂欢节。
Nobody imagined that 11 years ago, as a result of the self-mocking “Single’s Day” that young unmarried people created, a sub-culture called “Singles Day” would be absorbed by e-commerce and become the phenomenon of today's “Double 11” shopping carnival.
No one thought about 11.11 Singles Day, created with self-deprecation, becoming an e-commerce phenomenon 10 years ago, becoming an online shopping festival called the “Double 11”.
2009年11月11日，阿里巴巴第一次使用“光棍节大促销”的营销噱头：没人跟你谈恋爱，那么“单身狗”们快来网购吧。
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing slogan “Singles Day Big Sale” for the first time: If no one wants to date you, come online and shop!

结果令人意外，这一天淘宝商城（“天猫”前身）交易额突破5200万元，是当时日常交易额的10倍。
The result was unexpected, and on that day, the transaction volume of Taobao Mall (the predecessor of Tmall) exceeded RMB 52 million, which was 10 times of the daily transaction volume at that time.
As a result, the total trading volume of Taobao Mall (the predecessor of Tmall) reached RMB52 million that day, which was 10 times its daily trading volume at that time.
从此，“双11”就成为了阿里巴巴打造的购物狂欢节，从一开始的国内买家卖家自娱自乐，到现在全球商家的涌入，九年过去了，天猫“双11”千亿交易额已经是当年的3200多倍，令“黑色星期五”望尘莫及。
From then on, “Double 11” has become the shopping festival created by Alibaba, from domestic buyers and sellers indulging in fun, to the influx of global merchants. Nine years have passed, and the RMB 100 billion transaction volume of Tmall “Double 11” is more than 3,200 times higher than that of the first year, leaving Black Friday far behind.
Ever since then, “Double 11” has become the shopping carnival created by Alibaba; from the domestic buyers and sellers playing together, to the rush of global merchants now, nine years have passed; nowadays, the RMB 10 billion transactions of Tmall “Double 11” is over 3,200 times of the original, which is unimaginable to “Black Friday”.
跟风天猫“双十一”促销的，还有众多电商，其中“京东”最为强劲。
Many e-commerce platforms are following the “Double 11” promotional activities of Taobao, and Jingdong is the strongest among them.

Following the “Double 11”, there would be similar “Double 12” sales events and shopping season in the Christmas and New Year period.
After "Double 11," there will be "Double 12" promotions, and Christmas and New Year shopping periods.
跨过了新年，等待着中国消费者的还有春节前的年货采购档期、情人节购物档期，消费，不会放假。
After the new year, the Chinese consumers still have pre-Chinese New Year’s shopping season and Valentine’s Day shopping season to look forward to, and consumption will not take a break.
After New Year's, the spring festival gift buying period, and Valentine's Day are waiting for the Chinese consumers, and shopping will never take a break.
据新华每日电讯报道，按业内每个包装箱0.2公斤的通常标准保守估算，今年“双11”期间至少产生超过30万吨垃圾。

According to the manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing named Wang Shi who spoke to Xinhua News Agency, the amount of waste transported into the plant every day has exceeded 2,000 tons since the “Double 11” shopping festival, which exceeds the processing capacity of the incineration station.
包括苏宁在内的一些电商物流企业“双11”前推出了可回收重复使用的塑料快递盒、可以重复用作购物袋和垃圾袋的循环包装袋等，但嫌麻烦的消费者接受度并不高。
Some e-commerce logistic companies, including Suning, launched recyclable and reusable plastic delivery boxes and cyclic packaging bags before the 11.11, which can be reused as shopping bags and trash bags. However, the acceptance of such initiatives by consumers is not high because they are troublesome.
Several e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Sunning, launched recyclable, reusable plastic delivery boxes and cyclical packaging boxes that could be used repeatedly as shopping bags and garbage bags before "Double 11," but the consumption acceptance is not high.
张冬方：在德国拉开的移动支付战局不具期待性。
Zheng Dongfang: The development of mobile payment in Germany has no expectation.
Zhang Dongfang: I believe that the mobile payment situation that began in Germany is promising.
微信支付和支付宝不过把战场搬到了欧洲，竞争对手没变，抢夺阵地也没变——中国人，这也算全球化？
Instead, WeChat Pay and Alipay just moved their battlefields to Europe, and the competitors stayed the same, and they were still fighting over territories - Chinese people. Would this also count as globalization?
WeChat Pay and Alipay just moved the battlefield to Europe, and our competitors are the same, and we still want to occupy territories - the Chinese people; and this is also globalization?
有支付宝的地方，必有微信支付。
Where there is Alipay, there must be WeChat Pay.
As there is Alipay, there must be WeChat Pay.
按照和德国电子支付服务商Wirecard的协议，微信支付今年11月正式着手落地德国，并逐渐在欧洲范围内的商家进行布局。
In accordance with the agreement with Wirecard, a German electronic payment service provider, WeChat Pay officially started to launch in Germany in November of this year, and then began to set up shop with businesses throughout Europe.
In accordance with the agreement with Wirecard, a German EPS provider, WeChat Pay officially started the localization project in Germany in November this year and gradually proceeded to layout businesses throughout Europe.
一直以来，支付宝和微信支付在全球化的道路上一路高歌。
Over the past few years, Alipay and WeChat Pay have continued to soar on the road of globalization.
Alipay and WeChat Pay have been on the road to globalization all along.
对于中国的移动支付的全球化方式，艾瑞咨询《中国第三方移动支付行业研究报告2017》总结为两种：一是通过战略投资，经验输出，入股并扶持国外本土移动支付企业。
There are two modes of globalization for mobile payments in China, as summed up by AIR Consulting in the report: one is to invest strategically, export experience, and be a shareholder and supporter of overseas local mobile payment companies.
Alibaba's globalization of mobile payment in China was summarized as two methods by Analysys: the first is via strategic investment, experience export, equity holding and support for overseas native mobile payment companies.
确实，得中国人得天下。
It is indeed true that the Chinese are all-conquering.
It is true that to get Chinese people, all the world is yours.
中国经济发展迅猛，再加上人口基数大，中国游客在欧洲的花销是一个诱人的数字。
The rapid growth of the Chinese economy, along with a large base of consumers, paints a compelling picture of Chinese tourists’ spending in Europe.
With China's booming economy, a large population base, and expenses during trips in Europe, Chinese tourists are a highly attractive group.
但这也注定了，这次在德国拉开的中国移动支付战局不具期待性。
But this was also a given. The Chinese mobile payment war, that began in Germany, was not very promising.
However, it is inevitable that this Chinese mobile payment scenario opened in Germany has no expectations.
更具开拓性的探讨是，中国的移动支付能否在欧洲本土开疆拓土？
Another more forward-looking exploration is whether China’s mobile payment services can be launched domestically in Europe.
More pioneering discussion was about whether Chinese mobile payment could expand to the native Europe?
以德国为例。
Let's take Germany as an example.
For example, Germany.
被施了魔法的“新零售”
“New Retail” with magic
The “new retail” that was cast with a spell
陈歆磊、杨凯涵：亚马逊在挤进全球十大零售商时候宣布进军书店和杂货铺，不论时机还是动机都很值得玩味。
Chen Xinyan and Yang Kaihe: Amazon announced their entry into bookstores and general merchandise stores when they joined the top ten global retailers; the timing and motive are worth thinking about.
Chen Xinlei, Yang Keihuan: When it announced its move into bookstores and convenience stores, Amazon’s timing and motives are worth pondering.
